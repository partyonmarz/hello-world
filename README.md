Hello world tutorial program for Github

My name is Patrick Jagla and I am interested in interactive video and sound.  I enjoy working in a wide variety of softwares such as Albeton Live, Touchdesigner, Processing and Cinema 4D and I am constantly expiermenting with new mediums.  I seek out challenging projects that require me to troubleshoot and solve a wide variety of problems in the heat of the moment.  I generally work on both the pre-programming aspect of a live show and also do the performance for the live show as well.
